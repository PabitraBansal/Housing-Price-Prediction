# Housing-Price-Prediction
Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

## Dataset (from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/))
1. test.csv - Contains the test data (without proceessing)
2. train.csv - Contains the train data (without processing)
3. data_description.txt - Contains the description about eact feature in the dataset.

## Dataframes
The folder cointains the datasets after preprocessing and features selection.

## Weights

Since the file size of RandomForest Models were too large(>25MB) they could not be uploaded on GitHub.
All the saved models can be accessed through this link:

## Notebooks
We have prepared two notebooks, one in which the outliers were removed, while in the other one we
replaced the outliers with median of the feature.
1. Housing_Median.ipynb
2. Housing_Remove.ipynb

The notebooks cointain the outputs and graphs.
